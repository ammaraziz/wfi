BUILD INFORMATION:
Benchmarks at NSC have shown this binary to be more than twice as fast as the 
official (gcc compiled) binary release (see DISCLAIMER below).

This binary was built using the enclosed src/mk file (replacement for the one 
included in the official source code release). No other changes have been made 
to the original Muscle source code.


DISCLAIMER:
1) The alignments produced by the binaries in this release may not be identical
to the ones produced by the official gcc compiled release. Discrepancies have 
been noted and deemed non-critical by NSC and the author of the software, 
however if you rely on bit equivalence in the results, you should use the 
official precompiled binaries instead, available at the software website.
2) This release is made available without any warranties or guarantees 
whatsoever, whether explicit or implicit, regarding performance, security, 
correctness, safety, suitability for specific purposes, or other factors. In no
way shall NSC or Intel, or any of their suppliers, be held accountable for any

association to this release.
3) This release is available free of charge at the sole discretion of NSC, and 
may be updated, changed or discontinued without notice.
